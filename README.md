# Attention Shoppers V2

## Introduction:
Attention Shoppers is just beginning its journey into development, with the ambitious goal of having the first playable iteration ready for May 2024. As the sole developer behind this project, I'm excited to take on the challenge and bring this concept to life. While there's currently no formal team in place, I'm open to collaboration and appreciate any contributions from those willing to lend their expertise along the way. Together, we'll work towards crafting an engaging and immersive multiplayer experience set in the chaotic aisles of a closing grocery store.

## Concept:
Attention Shoppers is a fast-paced multiplayer game set in a grocery store that's about to close for the night. Players compete against each other in a frantic race to collect items from their shopping lists before the store shuts its doors. Along the way, they must navigate through crowded aisles, avoid hazards, and outsmart both NPC employees and fellow shoppers to be the first to complete their shopping and make it to the checkout counter.

## Key Features:
**Multiplayer Madness:** Players can join online multiplayer matches with friends or compete against random opponents in real-time races through the store.


**Closing Time Rush:** With the store's closing time looming, players must quickly gather items from their shopping lists scattered throughout the store's aisles.


**Dynamic Store Environment:** The grocery store is a bustling environment filled with interactive elements such as moving shopping carts, spills, and obstacles. Players must navigate through crowded aisles while avoiding hazards and strategic traps set by opponents.


**Strategic Gameplay:** Players can strategically deploy obstacles and create distractions to impede their opponents' progress. However, they must also remain vigilant to avoid getting caught by NPC employees or falling victim to other players' traps.


**Unique Power-Ups:** Collectable power-ups scattered throughout the store provide temporary advantages, such as speed boosts, item reveals, or temporary invisibility to evade detection.


**NPC Employees:** Patrolling NPC employees add an additional challenge as players must avoid direct contact to prevent getting kicked out of the store.


## Real-Time Chat:
**Social Interaction:** Players can communicate with each other via real-time chat, fostering camaraderie, competition, and interaction among participants.
**Strategy Coordination:** Chat allows players to coordinate strategies, share tips, and form alliances with teammates or negotiate with opponents.
**Community Building:** Chat promotes community building within the game, encouraging players to form friendships, share experiences, and participate in ongoing discussions beyond individual matches.
**Accessibility:** Chat supports text-based communication, with the potential for future expansion to include voice chat or other communication features based on player feedback and preferences.

**Level Progression:** The game features multiple levels set in different sections of the grocery store, each with its own set of challenges and obstacles. As players progress, they face increasing difficulty and complexity.


**Leaderboards and Rankings:** At the end of each match, players are ranked based on their completion time and performance. Top-ranking players earn rewards and climb the global leaderboard.


## Gameplay Flow:
**Lobby and Matchmaking:** Players enter the game lobby, where they can invite friends, join public matches, or enter matchmaking queues.
**Closing Time Dash:** Once the match begins, players spawn at different locations within the grocery store and race to collect items from their shopping lists.
**Strategic Plays:** Players strategically deploy obstacles, create distractions, and outmaneuver opponents while avoiding hazards and NPC employees.
**Race to the Checkout:** The intensity builds as players rush to complete their shopping lists and make it to the checkout counter before the store closes.
**Post-Match Results:** After the match, players receive scores and rankings based on their performance. Rewards are distributed, and players have the option to queue for another match or return to the main menu.

## Conclusion:
Attention Shoppers offers a thrilling multiplayer experience filled with strategic gameplay, fast-paced action, and intense competition. As players race against time and each other in a chaotic grocery store environment, they'll need quick reflexes, clever tactics, and a sharp eye to emerge victorious before the store's closing bell rings.
